#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Constant time complexity - O(1) - This while loop in this function will always run only twice. By the second iteration, it will have terminated due to a > n^3. 

b) Quadratic time complexity - O(n^2) - The nested loops indicates that the function will run n^2 times.

c) Linear time complexity - O(n) - The function will call itself recursively n times.
